Throughout my years of working job to job and switching up different paths of trying to find comfort in my life my decision to become a software engineer. This decision happened during an overnight shift while working as a security guard at the Smithsonian Institution. Doing heavy research about the art of becoming a developer I've become intrigued by what this career is about. I've always had a competitive nature about who I am and the person I can be if I buckled down and focus on what's important.

Flatiron school is not only an opportunity for me to elevate my life in a career aspect but being apart of this school has instilled discipline in me as well as a source of therapy. As I go through the motions through each assignment, mentally it's showing me that I will have to go outside the box and reach out to different sources i.e. google, youtube, etc. 

Out of anything that I've done in my life I must say that going through this boot camp has become the toughest yet most intriguing experience I've ever become apart of. Now that I've made that "leap of faith" its time to be consistent and execute throughout this curriculum.
